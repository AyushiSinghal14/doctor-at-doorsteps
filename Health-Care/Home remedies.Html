            <p class="para-tag">
              The stomach normally secretes acid that is essential in the
              digestive process. This acid helps in breaking down the food
              during digestion. When there is excess production of acid by the
              gastric glands of the stomach, it results in the condition known
              as acidity.

              When we think of allergies the classic signs that come to mind are
              continuous sneezing, breakout of a rash, or shortness of breath.
              These signs are unusual responses by an individual in an otherwise
              normal environment. So, what exactly are allergies? Allergies
              include immune system-based hypersensitive reactions. There is an
              increase in IgE or IgG/IgA/IgM antibodies to the allergic
              reactions.

              High blood pressure (hypertension), often called a silent killer
              is the pressure of the blood in the arteries. Blood pressure is
              typically recorded as the systolic pressure (as the heart beats)
              over the diastolic pressure (time between two beats). A consistent
              blood pressure reading of 140/90 mm Hg or higher is considered
              high blood pressure.

              A burn is a type of injury to the skin or flesh that is caused by
              heat, friction, chemicals or radiation. Burns that are extensive
              or deep can be fatal but modern treatment methods have improved
              the outcome and the longterm outcome generally depends on the size
              of the burn and the age of the patient.

                hold it under cold running water for 5 to 10 minutes. If this is
                not possible, immerse the burn in cool water or use a cold
                compress.

                place them over the burn. Use a clean strip of gauze to hold
                them in place. This remedy will reduce the pain and
                inflammation. Skip your hot showers and opt for cool showers
                instead as this too will help to reduce the inflammation.
